# CSE 3666 - Spring 2024

This repo is for CSE 3666 in Spring 2024. We will use multiple platforms this semester.

*   HuskyCT. Most of the course materials, including syllabus, schedule,
    lecture slides, and homework assignments, will be posted in HuskyCT. We
    might also use it for online quizzes.

    Here is [the Blackboard help center for students](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Student)

*   Gradescope. We will use Gradescope to grade most of the lab assignments and some homework questions.
    The submission links will be created in HuskyCT. 

    Here are the instructions for [submitting an assignment on
    Gradescope](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work).

Your submitted work in lab, homework, quiz, exam, etc. should be clean and tidy. Always write good, concise comments in code.  

When grading coding questions manually, we check the correctness but also the **quality**. For example, RISC-V idioms should be recognized and written
properly. Some idioms are listed on [this page.](https://github.com/zhijieshi/cse3666/blob/master/rv-examples/risc-v-idioms.md)
In addition, good code should be easy to read.

## File storage

**Important:** Save your files to cloud storage like OneDrive. Local storage on lab computers or UConn AnyWare Desktop may be purged. 

As of January 2023, UITS has enabled OneDrive on UConn Anyware Desktop. The File Explorer has a link (OneDrive - University of Connecticut) to the user's OneDrive folder. In PowerShell, the folder "OneDrive - University of Connecticut" is in the user's home directory. The files can also be accessed with the Web interace through [email.uconn.edu](https://email.uconn.edu/).

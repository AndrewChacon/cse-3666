## Description

### Task 1

Follow the instructions on [this page](https://github.com/zhijieshi/cse3666/blob/master/misc/rars.md)
to install RARS and run RISC-V programs in RARS. The page has a link
to [RISC-V examples.](https://github.com/zhijieshi/cse3666/tree/master/rv-examples)

Copy code in `01-hello.s` to a new file `lab0.s`. Modify the `msg` string so
the program prints the following. There is no space after the ending dot.

    Hello, welcome to CSE 3666. Spring is coming.

Submit `lab0.s` in Gradescope. There is a link in HuskyCT.

### Task 2

Study the slides in `lab0-numbers.pdf` to learn/review converson of numbers of
different radices.

- Binary to decimal.
- Decimal to binary.
- Hexadecimal to decimal.
- Decimal to hexadecimal.

Practice on [this page](https://zhijieshi.github.io/cse3666/binarynumbers/).
For now, you can click the Config button and uncheck "Bits are signed".

## Deliverables

Submit `lab0.s` in HuskyCT.
